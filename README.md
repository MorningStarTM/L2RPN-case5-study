# L2RPN-case5-study
This repo contains study of KAN intergrated RL agents for l2rpn(learning to run power network) challenege.

### Description of Project
This project involves the training and evaluation of reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Actor-Critic (AC), Deep Q-Network (DQN),  KAN (Kolmogorov-arnold-network) basd for the L2RPN (Learning to Run a Power Network) challenge. The goal is to develop and study about robust agents capable of managing power networks efficiently, and optimize their learning processes.

### Result
| **PPO** | **KAN-PPO** |
